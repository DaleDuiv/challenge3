## Description

We were provided with the CSS and HTML.
The task is to create a new secure password,
When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, a series of window prompts appear to work out relavant criteria.
Criteria used was lowerCase, UpperCase, numerical and symbols. Password to be no less than 8 and no more than 128 characters, and if an incorrect input was put in, an error would occur.

I did make a prompt to make sure an alert appeared if no criteria was selected, however I did also decide to input a default option of lowercase letters.
